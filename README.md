# Data-Mining
## This repository contains work on web scrapping, machine learning models like Linear regression, Classfication models and Image claasification models. 
## The Linear regression explores the use of linear regression to predict Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the United States. I analyzed historical data on GDP and various economic factors to identify potential relationships and build a predictive model. 
## The classification model is build on a telecommunication customer dataset to predict the customet churn rate. Predicting customer churn allows companies to proactively identify customers at risk and implement targeted retention strategies.A comparative analysis of nine classification models (Decision Tree, KNN, Gaussian NB, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM Linear, SVM RBF, SVM Polynomial, and SVM Sigmoid) was conducted based on their performance metrics  and KNN model had the strongest performance based on precision and recall score. 
## Image classification model to identify sea animals. Manual image labelling for sea animals identification can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Automating this process using image classification techniques offers significant benefits. This study investigates machine learning models for differentiating between seahorse and sea ray images. These creatures exhibit distinct body shapes and textures, making them suitable for classification based on visual features.The chosen dataset contained images from various marine animals. We pre-processed the images by resizing them to a uniform size and converting them to grayscale for consistent feature extraction. Supervised machine learning models were trained on extracted features and corresponding class labels (seahorse or sea ray).We evaluated various machine learning models: Decision Tree, KNN, Gaussian NB, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM with linear, RBF, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels. Hyperparameters like the number of neighbours for KNN and the number of estimators for Random Forest were adjusted for optimal performance. K-Fold cross-validation was employed to evaluate model performance on unseen data. GNB exibits the highest accuracy and good overall performace. 
## This Python script aims to collect and analyze athlete data, men and women volleyball players, men and women swimmers. It utilizes web scraping techniques to extract athlete names and heights from online roster pages of various college teams. The script employs the requests library for retrieving web page content and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML. The extracted data is then organized into a Pandas DataFrame, allowing for data manipulation and analysis. The primary analysis involves calculating the average height of m players and identifying the athletes with the tallest and shortest heights. A comparitive analysis is performed showing the average height distribution across the 4 different team categories (mens’ swimming, men’s volleyball, women’s swimming, women’s volleyball).
